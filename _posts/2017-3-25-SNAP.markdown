The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) offers assistance to millions of low-income people by providing benefits to buy food. More on the program can be learned from the [US Department of Agriculture's website](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap) and for the State of Washington, from its [Department of Social and Health Services' website](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/esa/community-services-offices/basic-food).


**According to 5-year estimates of the data collected during the the 2011-2015 American Community Survey, approximately 14.3% of Washington households received food stamps/SNAP.**

**Question 1:** How do the different counties in Washington stack up against each other with respect to the percentage of households that have received food stamps/SNAP? (Margin of error in measurement is also displayed.)
