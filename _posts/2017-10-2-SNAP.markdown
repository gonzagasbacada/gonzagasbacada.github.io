The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) offers assistance to millions of low-income people by providing benefits to buy food. More on the program can be learned from the [US Department of Agriculture's website](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap) and for the State of Washington, from its [Department of Social and Health Services' website](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/esa/community-services-offices/basic-food).
