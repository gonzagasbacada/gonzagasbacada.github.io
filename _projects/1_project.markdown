In 2014-2015, Gonzaga University conducted the Mapping Assets and Promoting Strengths (MAPS) project. (Both, Matthew McPherson and Vivek Patil, were members of the team.) The immediate objective of the project was to identify assets, primarily in the Logan neighborhood, that could serve as change-agents at a subsequent time to spear-head developmental initiatives. (Few assets were also identified from adjoining neighborhoods of the Northeast quadrant of Spokane that contained the Garry and Shaw Middle Schools service areas.) One key outcome of that project was an interactive geographic map of 1321 assets from these neighborhoods. This map was developed by Vivek Patil. (More information on the MAPS project can be obtained from <a href="http://www.gonzaga.edu/student-life/MAPS/default.asp" target="blank">its website at Gonzaga University.</a>) (**Please note that all of the visualizations are interactive in nature. Hovering over/clicking individual observations may provide more information.**)
