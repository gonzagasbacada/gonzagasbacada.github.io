This project extended the outcomes of the MAPS project in two distinct ways. One, it identified characteristics that residents of the Logan neighborhood believed were important for *any* good neighborhood. Second, it provides an evaluation of the Logan neighborhood in terms of these important characteristics. These results are based on surveys of 788 residents of the Logan neighborhood that were conducted in the first half of 2016. Data were collected by Matthew McPherson's class and the analyses were done by Vivek Patil.
